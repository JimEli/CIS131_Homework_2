# Pima CC CIS131 Homework Assignment #2

Title: Payroll Calculator Class and Driver Program 

This program calculates the payroll for a group of employees using a multi-dimensional array. Regular pay, overtime pay and gross pay are calculated based upon hours worked and pay rate. The following equations define an employee's pay:
* Regular Pay = hours (<=40) * rate
* OT Pay = hours (>40) * rate * 1.5
* Gross Pay = Regular Pay + OT pay
 
Notes: 
* Use of double to represent currency is widely considered a bad choice. Use of Integer or BigDecimal circumvents floating-point errors.
* Compiled with java SE JDK 8, Update 102 (JDK 8u102).
* Classes combined for demonstration purposes.
* Includes multiple JUnit test cases for EliJames_HW2.java class.
 
Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements of PCC CIS-131.
